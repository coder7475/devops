# What is TDD?

TDD = Test Driven Development Definition

## Test Driven Development Definition

Coding Methodology where test are written before code is written.

## TDD Goals

- Know when something breaks and where
- Know that the whole system is working correctly

### Different Types of Testing

1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. System (end to end) tests
4. Acceptance tests

## Workflow without TDD

1. Choose something to work on
2. Build it based on specifications
3. Test it with small scripts

**Results are the same** regardless of method - TDD forces you to **pritorize** tasks.
